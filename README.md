# WebGL Projects

To run any of these projects, simply `git clone https://github.com/mxgordon/WebGL-Projects.git`, and nothing else is needed as long as you have a brower installed (I have only tested it for Chrome & Edge, so others may or may not work).

## SVG Editor/Viewer

First, open the `index.html` in your browser. Then you can optionally open any of the SVGs in the `/files/` folder to view. 

To draw, right-click in any two points to draw a line between them. Additionally, you can pan with the left click and rotate with the scroll wheel.

Finally, the final SVG can be exported and downloaded with the `Download SVG` button.

## Animated Subdividing Cube

After opening `index.html` in your browser you can use any of the following keybinds to animate and change the view.

 - `m`: Toggles the wireframe vs shaded view of the shape
 - `a`: Toggles the animation (the shape moving around the track)
 - `l`: Switches between Gouraud and Phong shading
 - `e`: Will subdivide the shape further (maximum 5 subdivisions)
 - `q`: Will unsubdivide the shape
 - `i`: Will subdivide the track (maximum 8 subdivisions)
 - `j`: Will unsubdivide the track

## OBJ Scene Renderer
